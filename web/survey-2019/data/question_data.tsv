57	1	I’m proud to share The Trevor Project’s inaugural ^National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health.^		
46	1	This is our first wide-ranging report from a cross-sectional national survey of LGBTQ youth across the United States. With over 34,000 respondents, it is the largest survey of LGBTQ youth mental health ever conducted and provides a critical understanding of the experiences impacting their lives.		text
46	2	This ground-breaking survey provides new insights into the challenges that LGBTQ youth across the country face every day, including suicide, feeling sad or hopeless, discrimination, physical threats and exposure to conversion therapy.		highlight
46	3	The data provides a sobering look at how far we still have to go to protect LGBTQ young lives. But the survey also reveals the resilience and diversity of LGBTQ youth and provides guidance on what can be done to enable them to survive and thrive. Among some of the key findings of the report from LGBTQ youth in the survey:		text
46	4	^39% of LGBTQ youth^ seriously considered attempting suicide in the past twelve months, with more than half of transgender and non-binary youth having seriously considered		list
46	5	^71% of LGBTQ youth^ reported feeling sad or hopeless for at least two weeks in the past year		list
46	6	^Less than half of LGBTQ respondents^ were out to an adult at school, with youth much less likely to disclose their gender identity than sexual orientation		list
46	7	^2 in 3 LGBTQ youth^ reported that someone tried to convince them to change their sexual orientation or gender identity, with youth who have undergone conversion therapy more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as those who did not		list
46	8	^71% of LGBTQ youth^ in our study reported discrimination due to either their sexual orientation or gender identity		list
46	9	^58% of transgender and non-binary youth^ reported being discouraged from using a bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity		list
46	10	^76% of LGBTQ youth^ felt that the recent political climate impacted their mental health or sense of self		list
46	11	^87% of LGBTQ youth^ said it was important to them to reach out to a crisis intervention organization that focuses on LGBTQ youth and ^98%^ said a safe space social networking site for LGBTQ youth would be valuable to them		list
46	12	The Trevor Project’s National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health is part of our commitment to use research and data to continually improve our life-saving services for LGBTQ youth and expand the knowledge base for organizations around the globe.		highlight
46	13	This survey builds upon critical research done by many of our partner organizations over the years and we are particularly proud that it is inclusive of youth of more than 100 sexual orientations and more than 100 gender identities from all 50 states across the country.		text
46	14	We hope this report elevates the voices and experiences of LGBTQ youth, providing insights that can be used by the many organizations working alongside The Trevor Project to support LGBTQ young people around the world. We also hope this report shows LGBTQ youth that we hear them, that their lives have value, and that we are here to support them 24/7.		text

47	2	A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data using an online survey platform between February 2, 2018 and September 30, 2018.		text
47	3	A sample of individuals ages 13–24 who resided in the United States were recruited via targeted ads on social media. No recruitment was conducted via The Trevor Project website or any of The Trevor Project social media sites. Respondents were defined as being LGBTQ if they identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual, a gender identity other than cisgender, or both. In order to ensure representativeness of the sample, targeted recruitment was conducted to ensure adequate sample sizes with respect to geography, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Qualified respondents completed a secure online questionnaire that included a maximum of 110 questions.		text
47	4	Questions on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) were aligned with the best practices identified in SOGI measurement. Questions on depressed mood and suicidality in the past 12 months were taken from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey to allow for direct comparisons to their nationally representative sample. Each question related to mental health and suicidality was preceded by a message stating, 		text
47	5	“If at any time you need to talk to someone about your mental health or thoughts of suicide, please call The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386.”		highlight
47	6	Participation was voluntary, informed consent was obtained, and no names or personal details were included ensuring confidentiality. 		text
47	7	A total of 34,808 youth consented to complete the online survey. Youth who indicated that they lived outside of the U.S. (n=475) received a message that they were ineligible to participate in the survey. Youth who indicated that they were both cisgender and straight (n=294) were excluded from the sample. A filter was applied to indicate youth who either a) completed less than half of the survey items or b) reached the end of the survey within three minutes (n=8,091). 		text
47	8	Additionally, a mischievous responders analysis identified and removed 52 youth who either provided highly unlikely answers (e.g. selecting all possible religious affiliations and race/ethnicity categories) and/or who provided obvious hate speech about LGBTQ populations in any of the free response options.		text
47	9	The final analytic sample was comprised of 25,896 LGBTQ youth in the United States. 		highlight
47	10	Preliminary analyses were conducted to identify any potential problems with redundancy (e.g. multicollinearity) among similar variables such as experiences of discrimination and victimization. All variables contributed uniquely to indicators related to suicidality.		text
47	11	This report uses “transgender and non-binary” as an umbrella term  to encompass non-cisgender youth, which includes young people who identify as transgender or non-binary as well as gender expansive, differently gendered, gender creative, gender variant, genderqueer, agender, gender fluid, gender neutral, bigender, androgynous, or gender diverse. 		text
48	1	In order to better understand how our sample compares to a national probabilistic sample, we included questions regarding suicidality that were identical to those used by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS).		text
48	2	Analyses were conducted to compare rates of seriously considering suicide and attempting suicide in the past 12 months among youth ages 13–18 in our sample to the 2017 YRBS sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth.		text
48	3	YRBS prevalence rates among LGB youth for seriously considering suicide (48%) were comparable to rates among the same age range in our sample (45%).		highlight
48	4	Similarly 23% of LGB youth in the 2017 YRBS reported a suicide attempt in the past 12 months compared to 24% in our sample.		text
49	1	The Trevor Project is the world's largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer & questioning (LGBTQ) young people. The Trevor Project offers a suite of 24/7/365 crisis intervention and suicide prevention programs, including TrevorLifeline, TrevorText, and TrevorChat as well as the world’s largest safe space social networking site for LGBTQ youth, TrevorSpace.

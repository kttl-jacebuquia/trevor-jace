	0_0_0_1_0	1	text	The dramatic impact of COVID-19 on mental health—especially that of LGBTQ youth—is just starting to be understood. But what remains clear is that suicide is still a public health crisis and the second leading cause of death among young people. The need for robust research, systematic data collection, and comprehensive mental health support has never been greater.	
	0_0_0_1_0	2	highlight	The Trevor Project’s 2020 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health is our second annual release of new insights into the unique challenges that LGBTQ youth face every day.	
	0_0_0_1_0	3	text	Building on the findings of our inaugural survey, it provides critical insights around LGBTQ youth mental health disparities, discrimination, housing instability, barriers to affirming health care, subjection to conversion therapy, and suicide. The survey also highlights how safe spaces and social support positively impact the well-being of LGBTQ youth.	
	0_0_0_1_0	4	text	Representing the experiences of over 40,000 LGBTQ youth ages 13-24 across the United States, it is the largest survey of LGBTQ youth mental health ever conducted. This wealth of data highlights the resiliency and diversity of LGBTQ young people and demonstrates how important affirming one’s identity is to their health and wellness. Findings from this cross-sectional survey also point to best practices for how to support LGBTQ young people and contribute positively to their mental health.	
	0_0_0_1_0	5	text	Among some of the key findings of the report from LGBTQ youth in the survey:	
	0_0_0_1_0	6	list	^40% of LGBTQ respondents^ seriously considered attempting suicide in the past twelve months, with ^more than half^ of transgender and nonbinary youth having seriously considered suicide	
	0_0_0_1_0	7	list	^68% of LGBTQ youth^ reported symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in the past two weeks, including ^more than 3 in 4^ transgender and nonbinary youth	
	0_0_0_1_0	8	list	^48% of LGBTQ youth^ reported engaging in self-harm in the past twelve months, including ^over 60%^ of transgender and nonbinary youth	
	0_0_0_1_0	9	list	^46% of LGBTQ youth^ report they wanted psychological or emotional counseling from a mental health professional but were unable to receive it in the past 12 months	
	0_0_0_1_0	10	list	^10% of LGBTQ youth^ reported undergoing conversion therapy, with ^78% reporting^ it occurred when they were under age 18	
	0_0_0_1_0	11	list	^29% of LGBTQ youth^ have experienced homelessness, been kicked out, or run away	
	0_0_0_1_0	12	list	^1 in 3 LGBTQ youth^ reported that they had been physically threatened or harmed in their lifetime due to their LGBTQ identity	
	0_0_0_1_0	13	list	^61% of transgender and nonbinary youth^ reported being prevented or discouraged from using a bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity	
	0_0_0_1_0	14	list	^86% of LGBTQ youth^ said that recent politics have negatively impacted their well-being	
	0_0_0_1_0	15	list	^Transgender and nonbinary youth^ who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected	
	0_0_0_1_0	16	highlight	This year’s survey exemplifies our organization’s commitment to using research and data to prevent LGBTQ youth suicide.	
	0_0_0_1_0	17	text	We will continue to leverage new research to help inform our life-saving services for LGBTQ youth, as well as expand the knowledge base for organizations around the globe. Our partner organizations also conduct critical research, and we acknowledge that our life-saving programs and research build on their important work.	
	0_0_0_1_0	18	text	Given the lack of LGBTQ-inclusive data nationwide, we hope this report will provide valuable insights that can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the many organizations working alongside The Trevor Project to support LGBTQ young people everywhere.	
	0_0_0_1_0	19	text	The Trevor Project’s research, advocacy, education, and direct service programs will continue to elevate the voices and experiences of LGBTQ youth. Our hope is that by publicly sharing our resources and our support for them, LGBTQ youth will hear us loud and clear: that they are beautiful the way they are, that their lives are valuable, and that they are never alone. If you are an LGBTQ young person, please know that The Trevor Project is here to support you 24/7.

	8_3_0_1_0	1	text	A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data using an online survey platform between December 2, 2019 and March 31, 2020. A sample of individuals ages 13–24 who resided in the United States was recruited via targeted ads on social media. No recruitment was conducted via The Trevor Project website or any of The Trevor Project social media sites. Respondents were defined as being LGBTQ if they identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual, a gender identity other than cisgender, or both. In order to ensure the representativeness of the sample, targeted recruitment was conducted to ensure adequate sample sizes with respect to geography, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Qualified respondents completed a secure online questionnaire that included a maximum of 150 questions. Questions on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) were aligned with the best practices identified in SOGI measurement. Questions on considering and attempting suicide in the past 12 months were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey to allow for direct comparisons to their nationally representative sample.	
	8_3_0_1_0	2	text	Each question related to mental health and suicidality was preceded by a message stating:	
	8_3_0_1_0	3	highlight	“If at any time you need to talk to someone about your mental health or thoughts of suicide, please call The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386.”	
	8_3_0_1_0	4	text	Participation was voluntary, and informed consent was obtained. No names or personal details were included to ensure anonymity. A total of 60,795 youth from unique IP addresses consented to complete the online survey. Youth who indicated that they lived outside of the U.S. (_n_=210), were outside the 13–24 age range (_n_=551) or who did not meet predefined demographic characteristics during the targeted recruitment phase (_n_=6,412) were directed out of the survey. To create the analytic sample, a filter was applied to remove youth who did not reach the midpoint of the survey, which included questions on suicide (_n_=13,343). Youth who were not LGBTQ (_n_=205) were excluded from the analytic sample.	
	8_3_0_1_0	5	text	Additionally, a mischievous responders analysis identified and removed 73 youth who provided obvious hate speech about LGBTQ populations in the free response options or who reported answering dishonestly.	
	8_3_0_1_0	6	highlight	The final analytic sample was comprised of 40,001 LGBTQ youth ages 13–24 in the United States.	
	8_3_0_1_0	7	text	Preliminary analyses were conducted to identify any potential problems with redundancy (e.g., multicollinearity) among similar variables such as experiences of discrimination and victimization. All variables contributed uniquely to indicators related to suicide attempts.

	8_4_0_1_0	0	text	In order to better understand how our sample compares to a national probabilistic sample, we included questions regarding considering and attempting suicide that were identical to those used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS).	
	8_4_1_1_0	1	text	Analyses were conducted to compare rates of seriously considering suicide and attempting suicide in the past 12 months among youth ages 13–18 in our sample to the 2017 YRBS sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) high school students.	
	8_4_1_1_0	2	highlight	YRBS prevalence rates among LGB youth for seriously considering suicide (48%) were comparable to rates among the same age range in our sample (47%).

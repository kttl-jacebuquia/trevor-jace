No recruitment was conducted via The Trevor Project website or any of The Trevor Project’s social media sites. Respondents were defined as being LGBTQ if they identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual, a gender identity other than cisgender, or both. In order to ensure representativeness of the sample, targeted recruitment was conducted to ensure adequate sample sizes with respect to geography, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Qualified respondents completed a secure online questionnaire that included a maximum of 142 questions. Questions on considering and attempting suicide in the past 12 months were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey to allow for comparisons to their nationally representative sample.

Additionally, 27,588 youth were screened out of the survey due to quotas for race/ethnicity already being met, resulting in an eligible sample of 54,559 respondents. A validity check was placed midway through the survey which asked participants to select “agree” from a five-point statement with answers ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Youth who did not select “agree” (_n_=804) or who did not reach the validity question in the mid-point of the survey (18,365) were removed from the analytic sample.
